# Make a short needs / risk assessment

- web interface program (for scientific use, BLAST like)

- web part
  - host website
    - risk type: loss of access
    - impact: high
    - likelihood: medium
    - mitigation: sharing of responsibility, documentation (!), storage of docs, chose stable host

  - website host capacity
    - risk type: speed drops, 503 errors
    - impact: high
    - likelihood: low - medium
    - mitigation: have a dynamic model for capacity, keeping requirements in mind when developing the web interface 

  - compatibility across devices / browsers
    - risk type: incompatible with (usually) phones
    - impact: medium
    - likelihood: high
    - mitigation: state which browsers are supported -> DOCs!, keep phone compatibility in mind when planning times, chose few browsers that are typical 

- software
  - OS compatibility
    - risk type: incompatibility with other OS than tested
    - impact: high
    - likelihood: high
    - mitigation: keep the target audience in mind for first dev. Broaden it to the Windows and Mac 

  
- responsibilites
- documentation
